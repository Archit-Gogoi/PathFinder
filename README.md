The paper represents the design of an Obstacle Avoiding Robot with the capability of detecting objects in its course and navigating around those objects by making a proper decision. It demonstrates a robotic unit based on Arduino UNO and Adafruit Motor Shield where the code is written in Arduino IDE Software. Obstacle avoidance is one of the considerable key factors for developing mobile robots.
